##Plan for moving the project forward after the event
This project will continue moving forward. In the short time since launch we've managed to raise thousands of DAI from the previous Gitcoin CLR and already have the opportunity to fund initiatives across three different continents. We will continue fostering the growth of this DAO, and allow others to use a similar system in their own community.
