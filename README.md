## Plan for moving the project forward after the event
We will continue fostering the growth of this DAO, and allow others to use a similar system in their own communities and initiatives. 

Immediate next steps include:
  * Continue community development and onboarding
  * Create a voting schedule to agree upon
  * Drive engagement via UX improvements

In the short time since launch we've managed to raise thousands of DAI and will fund initiatives across three different continents beginning this week. Small steps forward toward a more decentralized governance!
